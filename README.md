The main goal is to design an Android App that will be used to match up a passenger with the nearest taxi driver. The app will be designed with THREE actors in mind: Prospective Passenger, Taxi driver, and Administrator.  GPS sensor in the phone will be used to determine Prospective Passengerâ€™s location, and an algorithm will be used to match up with the nearest Taxi.
